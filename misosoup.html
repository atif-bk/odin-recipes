        <h3>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese dish that’s both nourishing and simple, often enjoyed as a starter or alongside a
        main meal. The base of the soup is made from dashi (a light broth usually made with seaweed and bonito flakes) mixed
        with miso paste, which gives the soup its signature savory, umami flavor.</h3>

        <p>
            Common additions include tofu, seaweed (wakame), and scallions, though vegetables or mushrooms can also be added for
            extra flavor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Miso soup is loved for its comforting warmth and can easily be customized to suit different tastes while remaining quick
            and easy to prepare.
